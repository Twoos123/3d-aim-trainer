# 3D Aim Trainer

Inspired by AimLabs and Kovaaks (since I play alot of Counter Strike)


A simple 3D aim trainer game built with React and Three.js. The game features a space-themed background, a circular crosshair overlay, and targets that players need to shoot to score points. The game includes a timer and a restart button.

## Features

- Space-themed background
- Crosshair overlay that remains centered on the screen
- Targets that appear in a 90-degree area in front of the player
- Timer counting down from 30 seconds
- Score tracking
- Restart button to reset the game
